It was created by downloading licensing information from the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS), geocoding the spreadsheet records and converting them to a spatial format.

The following license types are represented:
Child Care Centers: Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day in a commercial setting.
Family Child Care: Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day, typically in the provider’s home or a local space, including a church.
Certified Child Care Center: Child care providers that are not required to be licensed, but are certified by DHS to be eligible to accept Child Care Assistance Program payments.

The approximately 10,000 records are combined into one layer, which can be queried to separate by license type. This version focuses on a smaller set of core attributes than can be found on DHS's Licensing Information Lookup Page; see that page for all the attributes: https://licensinglookup.dhs.state.mn.us/

Records represent licenses active as of the date shown in the Time Period of Content field. The official current status of licenses can be checked at the DHS licensing information lookup page.</abstract><supplinf>Statewide</supplinf><purpose>To provide state agencies and the general public with a basic overview of the locations of child care centers.</purpose></descript><status><update>Annually</update><progress>Complete</progress></status><keywords><place><placekey>Minnesota</placekey></place><theme><themekey>economy, childcare, child care, family care center, daycare, day care</themekey><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt></theme></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><timeperd><current>Data was obtained on April 3, 2023, and processed in April 2023.

License_Type: One of three license type descriptions:
- Child Care Centers: Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day in a commercial setting.
- Family Child Care: Programs licensed to provide care to children for less than 24 hours a day, typically in the provider’s home or a local space, including a church.
- Certified Child Care Center: Child care providers that are not required to be licensed, but are certified by DHS to be eligible to accept Child Care Assistance Program payments.
Name_of_Program: Name of the child care program.
AddressLine1: Line 1 of the address of the program.
AddressLine2: Line 2 of the address of the program.
(Note: whether or not these are mailing or physical location addresses is unknown.)
City, State, and Zip: Remaining address details.

1. Obtained spreadsheet of programs from Minnesota DHS
2. Geocoded spreadsheet in Esri software using StreetMap Premium Geocoder, projecting to UTM NAD83 Zone 15N (WKID 26915)
3. Manually reviewed and adjusted any "unmatched" or "tied" records
4. Recalculated column lengths to appropriate sizes
5. Created a query layer from the geodatabase in order to rename columns to match prior (2021) release
6. Exported query layer to new feature class inside GDRS geodatabase
7. Conducted manual review to determine geocoder efficacy:
    a. Imported previous (2018) version of data
    b. Set a 1/10th mile buffer around current data points
    c. Joined the two data tables
    d. Filtered by selecting the table records that had matching license numbers
    e. Sampled the matching records to determine if both data versions had points in the buffer zone. If not, checked to see if address was still the same between the years. If it was and points were not in the same buffer zone, used discretion to determine if address validation was needed and checked which point was correctly placed.</procdesc></procstep></lineage><logic>Comparison against previously validated dataset (2018).</logic><complete>Unknown</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>A sample of data points that existed in both the 2018 version and this 2023 version was taken and manually reviewed point-by-point to determine efficacy of the geocoder used. The 2023 data corrected some poor geocoding from the 2018 data. A notable difference in the point geocoding is that the 2018 version geocoded points to end of driveways whereas the 2023 version geocoded points to the building/structure.</horizpar></horizpa><vertacc><vertaccr>Not applicable</vertaccr></vertacc></posacc><attracc><attraccr>Attributes have not been checked for accuracy outside of normal Minnesota DHS licensing processes.</attraccr></attracc></dataqual><spref><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref></metadata>
