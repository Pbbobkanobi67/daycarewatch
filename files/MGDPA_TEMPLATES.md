# Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (MGDPA) Request Templates

## Overview

- Government must provide data in requested format if feasible
- Fee waivers available for public interest requests

RE: Minnesota Government Data Practices Act Request – CCAP Provider Payments

Dear Data Practices Compliance Official:

Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minn. Stat. § 13.01 et seq.), 
I request access to inspect and obtain copies of the following government data:

REQUESTED DATA:

1. Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) payments to all registered child care providers 
   statewide for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 (year-to-date), 
   including for each provider:
   
   - Provider name
   - Provider license number
   - Provider address (city, zip code)
   - Facility type (Child Care Center, Family Child Care, etc.)
   - Licensed capacity
   - Payment amounts by fiscal year
   - Payment amounts by month (if available)
   - Number of children served (aggregate, not individual child data)
   - CCAP subprogram (MFIP, DWP, BSF, TY, TYE)

2. Early Learning Scholarship (ELS) payments to providers for the same period, 
   with the same data fields.

3. Any provider payment holds, suspensions, or terminations during this period,
   including reason codes.

FORMAT REQUESTED:
Electronic format preferred: CSV, Excel (.xlsx), or database export. 
If multiple files are necessary, that is acceptable.

DATA CLASSIFICATION:
This data relates to government expenditures to private entities receiving public funds
and should be classified as public data under Minn. Stat. § 13.03.

Provider names, addresses, and payment amounts for public program participation
are not private data as they relate to the provider's business relationship with
the government, not personal family information.

RESPONSE DEADLINE:
Per Minn. Stat. § 13.03, subd. 2, I request a response within 10 business days.

FEE WAIVER REQUEST:
I request a waiver of fees under Minn. Stat. § 13.03, subd. 3, as this request
serves the public interest by promoting transparency in the use of public funds
for child care assistance. This data will be used for public accountability
research and journalism.

If fees cannot be waived, please provide an estimate before processing.

Please contact me at [email/phone] with any questions or clarifications needed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
